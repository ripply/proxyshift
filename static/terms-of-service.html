                <p>
                    As Proxy Shift asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that

                    5. Changes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are constantly updating our Services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which our Services are offered. If we make
                    changes that are material, we will let you know by posting on one of our blogs, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take
                    effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with our changes, then you should
                    stop using our Services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that
                    arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute arose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    11. Termination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Proxy Shift may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately.
                    If you wish to terminate this Agreement or your ProxyShift.com account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services. All provisions of
                    this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty
                    disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
                </p>
                <p>

                    part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions
                    will remain in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will
                    not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and
